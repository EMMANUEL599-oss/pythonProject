    <h2>Message Regarding the Upcoming Men's Meeting</h2>
    <p>Hi cous,</p>

    <p>Thank you for extending the invitation to the upcoming men’s meeting regarding our ancestral land boundaries. <span class="emoji">📍</span> I recognize the importance of such gatherings and respect the effort being made to address these matters. <span class="emoji">🤝</span></p>

    <p>However, I wish to share my thoughts openly and honestly. <span class="emoji">🗣</span></p>

    <p>Earlier this year, in March, my grandmother graciously gave me a small piece of land near my father’s home to build my manyatta house. <span class="emoji">🛖</span> I received this gift with gratitude <span class="emoji">🙏</span> and began planning for the future with hope. <span class="emoji">🌱</span></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, when this matter was later discussed among some of my uncles, it was met with denial and disregard — despite my grandmother’s clear intention. <span class="emoji">❌</span></p>

    <p>This experience left me deeply disappointed and hurt. <span class="emoji">💔</span> It felt as though my place, voice, and dignity were dismissed. <span class="emoji">😔</span> As someone who respects family and values fairness, I found this treatment unjust and disheartening. <span class="emoji">⚖</span></p>

    <p>Because of what was done to me, I have made the difficult decision not to attend the upcoming meeting. <span class="emoji">🚫</span> I do this not out of anger, but as a way of preserving my peace <span class="emoji">🕊</span> and standing firm in what I know to be true. <span class="emoji">💪</span></p>

    <p>I remain committed to the unity and well-being of our family <span class="emoji">❤</span> and I hope and pray that one day, we will be able to handle such matters with fairness, respect, and integrity for all — regardless of age or status. <span class="emoji">🤲🏾👣</span></p>

    <p>Wishing you a peaceful and constructive meeting. <span class="emoji">✨</span></p>

    <p class="signature">With respect,<br>Manu</p>
